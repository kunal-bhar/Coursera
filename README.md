# bistro-randomisation
A real-life bistro website (@David Chu's China Bistro) customised to display a random assortment of menu section, each time you click on the specials category. 
Populated data is fetched; a distinct menu-category appears each time you reload and click. Developed in relevance to Coursera Web-Dev.
